      description: Here you can go into detail about what you want to add. Try to be as specific as you can so that I can tell what it is you want to change. (Stop asking me to add new versions that I can't fix, I'll do that in my own time. No asking for apis (game servers like multiplayer mode) or any oauths yet.) If you're gonna ask for bots, you can provide a picture of a bot's player card here, in the comment section or on Instagram with a link.
