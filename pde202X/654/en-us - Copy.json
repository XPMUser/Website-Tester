    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_20": "First click one of your pets in the boxes here...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_21": "Then, click an open slot on your team. You can do this to remove pets from your team too!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_22": "Oh no! You ran out of hearts... You must be exhausted!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_23": "Don't worry, I'll heal you and your pets! But I'll have to charge you 100 gold...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_24": "Let's keep going! There's still so much to explore!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_25": "Uh oh! A monster is blocking our path!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_26": "The Academy is full of monsters, and monsters love a good wizard battle! Click on the monster to challenge it!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_27": "Pets are very useful - they level up and cast spells just like you! They can also help you in battle!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_28": "But before we go anywhere, you need to know how to defend yourself from monsters!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_29": "Oh no! It looks like a monster broke the bridge! How will we get across now?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_30": "Oh, nice! It looks like there are some pieces nearby...go collect them and we can rebuild the bridge ourselves!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_31": "Just click on the items around the map to pick them up...but watch out for monsters!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_32": "Great job! Now step back and watch this!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_33": "TADA! Not bad, huh? Okay, follow me!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_34": "In battle, monsters also cast spells. The first to defeat the other wins the battle!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_35": "Well, that's all I have left to teach you, but your wizard quest has only just begun!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_36": "Follow the path to the left to meet the first master wizard, Flora!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_37": "Don't you worry, though, because I'll always be here to help you out!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_38": "Do you want to heal you and your pets?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_39": "Oh dear! Try again!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_40": "Whoa, great job!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_41": "All finished! Let's head back, okay?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_42": "To become a true PRODIGY, you must travel all over the island and meet the master wizards!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_43": "Each master will teach you new spells, and award you a gemstone for completing their trials!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_44": "First, ask your teacher for your class code, and enter it here!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_45": "Now, enter your first and last name!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_46": "Create a password for your account! Remember to enter it twice!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_47": "Where do you live?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_48": "What grade are you in?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_49": "What does your wizard look like?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_50": "What is your wizard's name?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_51": "Here is your login information. Be sure to write these down!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_52": "Uh oh! Something went wrong...do you want to try again?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_53": "There's the healstone! When you're low on health, just click it to heal you and your pets!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_54": "There are the Sprikes! In battle, monsters drop items, and some items are used for quests!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_55": "Defeat the Sprikes until one of them drops some evidence for Flora!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_56": "Um...I think we found the TripTrop Trio!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_57": "Whew, that wasn't so bad...good job!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_58": "See that gate? It leads to the icy Shiverchill Mountains... but you need the Firefly Gem to open it!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_59": "WOW! That must be Gerald! I guess he's sleeping...thank goodness! We should probably tell Flora.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_60": "Oh no! A monster stole the flute! We'd better go tell Flora...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_61": "All we have to do is play this flute? Piece of cake, I used to take lessons!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_62": "Pftfbpfffppfbt!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_63": "What? I never said I was any good at it!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_64": "You opened the gate and got your first gemstone! Well done!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_65": "Next stop, Shiverchill Mountains!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_66": "Enter your parent's email if you're playing at home!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_67": "It looks like all the furnaces are out...no wonder it's so cold!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_68": "Whoa...what was that about?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_69": "We'd better tell Bok about this...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_70": "What the...this is NOT a shovel! We'd better go tell Bok.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_71": "Wait, those weren't the monsters?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_72": "Hmmm...well, you wouldn't happen to know where we could find some power crystals, would you?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_73": "Ummm...I think that's the REAL monster!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_74": "I'll bet that's the throne room, but it looks like the entrance is still frozen...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_75": "Look there! It's another power crystal...we can light another furnace!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_76": "Or maybe not? I guess the wyrm is still around...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_77": "Hey look! The furnace melted some of the ice!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_78": "You got your second gemstone and opened the second gate! Well done!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_79": "Next stop, Skywatch!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_80": "Welcome to Lamplight, the most magical town on the island and home of the Academy!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_81": "This is a great little town. I'm sure you'll find yourself right at home.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_82": "Let's go on a quick tour around town, shall we? There's so much to see!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_83": "Here is the Coliseum. Inside you can face the best wizards around, and earn great rewards!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_84": "But you should probably level up a bit first...some are pretty tricky! Let's keep moving!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_85": "This is the Shopping District - most of the shops in Lamplight are here.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_86": "Here is the Equipment Store. They sell wands, outfits and hats.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_87": "This is the Stylist Shop, where wizards can change their appearance! Let's continue, shall we?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_88": "This is the Town Square, the heart of Lamplight!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_89": "Many special events and festivals are hosted here...be sure to check in often!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_90": "All right! Only one more stop to go.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_91": "Down that way is the eastern gate, which leads to the Academy...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_92": "Unfortunately, it's been closed down ever since the Wardens disappeared... Maybe someday you'll get to see it for yourself!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_93": "Anyways, that's it for the tour! Come back often...the town changes all the time!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_94": "Great job! Be sure to talk to Boardy in Lamplight to get your reward.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_95": "That monster has the device! We'd better catch it!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_96": "HAHA! We've got you now!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_97": "Look, a note! It says that Broccolina is trimming the Bean-o-vator... Let's go find her.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_98": "What is THAT?!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_99": "Uh oh, those vines look too strong for our Vine Pruner. We should tell Benni and Broccolina about this!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_100": "We'd better help him out!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_101": "You got your third gemstone and opened the third gate! Well done!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_102": "Next stop, Bonfire Spire!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_103": "Uh, I think that's our cue to leave - fast!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_104": "Hey! Where do you think you're going!?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_105": "We get tricked a lot, don't we?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_106": "Sigh... Here we go again.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_107": "Well, actually, we didn't cook it.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_108": "Your Majesty, I present to you your new chef! Slurpy!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_109": "You got your fourth gemstone and opened the fourth gate! Well done!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_110": "Next stop, Barnacle Cove!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_111": "Let's head back, okay?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_112": "Oh no! Looks like we'll need to slip by Cebollini to get to the pot.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_113": "If you step into his circle of vision, he'll catch you and kick you out!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_114": "Hey, look there! There's a cauldron you can use to hide.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_115": "Press the button above your head to hide!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_116": "Walk around to take off the cauldron.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_117": "Now, enter your first name and last-name initial!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_118": "Hello?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_119": "Hey, listen!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_120": "You're going to be late for your first day of classes at the Academy!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_121": "Whoa! Hold up!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_122": "The name's Noot. I help bring new students to the Academy on their first day of class!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_123": "Who might you be?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_124": "Nice to meet you!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_125": "Let's head over.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_126": "Hey look, a monster! Monsters can be found everywhere, but they're pretty tame.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_127": "Uh...this one seems a bit grumpy. Looks like it wants to battle!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_128": "Since you're new at this, I'll shield you from spells for now!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_129": "Something really DID seem odd about that monster. Let's hurry up and get to the Academy.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_130": "By the way, if you're ever not sure what to do, just follow the magical guide hand I've created!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_131": "Click on the hand now!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_132": "Welcome to Lamplight Town! This place is just FULL of interesting people to meet and things to do!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_133": "Now, before we go further, you'll need to choose your very own pet!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_134": "Every wizard that studies at the Academy chooses a pet to train with.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_135": "These are the Academy's starter pets. Every student of the Academy has one.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_136": "Some pets even change to stronger forms if you train them enough!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_137": "Whoa, what has gotten into these pets?!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_138": "Choose which one you'd like to train!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_139": "Seems like this one is a bit grumpy, too. I think you'll have to battle it first!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_140": "When you train a pet, it becomes smarter and learns new spells. Just like you!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_141": "Another monster that wants to battle us? We need to scare it away before it causes trouble around here.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_142": "Come oooon, we have to get going!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_143": "Whew! We MADE IT! Well, it's time for you to get to class.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_144": "I have to go help other wizards find their way here, AND find out what's going on with all the monsters nearby, but I'm sure I'll see you around!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_145": "Do you feel that?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_146": "I...can sense something. A presence I've not felt since...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_147": "What WAS that?! Whoa...I don't feel so good...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_148": "AND WHERE DID THE WARDEN KEYSTONES GO?!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_149": "Without the Warden Keystones on their pedestals...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_150": "Oh no! It's the Puppet Master! This IS NOT good!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_151": "The name's Noot, and this here is my pal.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_152": "With the help of the power of the Wardens, we're going to put a stop to the Order's evil plans, once and for all!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_153": "I think it's time for us to get outta here...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_154": "I have a little secret I was keeping from the Puppet Master: the Warden Keystones can't be destroyed!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_155": "All that blast did was scatter them around the island.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_156": "Once we collect them all, we should be able to defeat the Puppet Master!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_157": "The Puppet Master must be the one who cast the mind spells on the monsters...",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_158": "But thanks to you, the town is safe once again!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_159": "I think you've earned your wizard name. What shall you be known as?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_160": "It's PERFECT!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_161": "Let's start the search for the Warden Keystones in Firefly Forest!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_162": "Let's open your map, it shows all the areas on the island!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_163": "One last thing. That shadow blast drained most of my magic, so I can't block spells for you anymore.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_164": "With the Wardens weakened, it's up to us to stop the evil Order of Influence and save the Academy!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_165": "Okay, follow me!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_166": "Uh oh, the quest you were working on has ended. Let's go talk to Swoopy and get another quest!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_167": "Hello! I'm Noot, pleasure to meet you.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_168": "Eve sent us. She said that the local people saw an ancient monster swimming around here.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_169": "Do you know anything about that?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_170": "Let's search the nearby areas Jelly Jim mentioned.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_171": "What IS this stuff? Oh no, I don't think we can go any further. Maybe Eve will know what to do.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_172": "Whoa... what is that tunnel in the sand from?! That does NOT look normal. And it's HUGE!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_173": "Let's go back and tell Eve about this right away!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_174": "Looks like the door's locked. Let's finish our tasks, then we can try to get it open later.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_175": "Let's go take that photo!",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_176": "The door's locked. Let's let Eve know.",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_177": "Are you playing from home or from school?",
    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_178": "This wizard will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine!",

    "DIALOGUE_NOOT_181": "In Titan battles, you first need to break through the Titan's barrier. Once its barrier breaks, it will lose some hearts.",

    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_20": "I got a plan, and it's a good one!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_21": "Head to the 3 levers and collect my cooking supplies; I always leave them there!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_22": "I'll bet you didn't know I could cook, huh? Yup, there's more to Slurpy than meets the eye!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_23": "But I need to know what the Queen actually LIKES... I know! Go talk to her guards, Mike and Hank!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_24": "If they don't know, nobody will!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_25": "Oh no, not turnips! They're super rare here, and the Royal Collectors are the only ones allowed to pick them.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_26": "I only need a couple... Maybe you can convince them to give you some?",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_27": "Well, it took lots of effort, but I'd say this quest is nearly complete! Slurpy the Great and his wizard will save the Kingdom with Turnip Stew!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_28": "Now, all you have to do is bring it to her... Easy as Turnip Pie!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_29": "This is stupid! Why couldn't the Royal Chef make his OWN food for the Queen?",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_30": "...",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_31": "Oh, right. Well, I guess it WAS kinda your fault he got fired.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_32": "But either way, we need to get that dish back! If only you could walk across lava...",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_33": "Hey! All you have to do is find the Boots of Hotwalk! They're in a chest, but legends say that only a fire monster has the key.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_34": "So, head out there and defeat the fire monsters!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_35": "Yup! That's the key alright!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_36": "Now, the chest should be pretty easy to find. The hard part is the 'Guardian'.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_37": "That's what we call the guy who guards it. Clever, huh? Don't worry, should be a piece of cake for a wizard!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_38": "Well, it's time for revenge! Slurpy the Fab and his almost-equally fab wizard friend against the fiendish Chef!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_39": "Now THAT'S a quest, right?",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_40": "Of course, you'll be going alone. I got more important things to do. Like planning, and stuff.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_41": "The Chef wants ME to meet the Queen?! Wow... What an honor!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_42": "I hope he's still not mad about the whole 'getting fired' thing.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_43": "WHAT!? But I only know how to make one dish...",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_44": "This is way too much pressure!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_45": "Maybe if I study as the Chef's apprentice, I can learn more about being a chef before I have a lot of responsibility.",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_46": "Thanks for your help!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_47": "And now that you've proven you're worthy, I can give you this: the Bonfire Gem!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_48": "Well, I can finally say it for real this time... QUEST COMPLETE!",
    "DIALOGUE_SLURPY_49": "We did it, friend! I couldn't have done it without you! Now, it's time for you to move on. There are other quests out there for you to discover!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_0": "It is finally done. With the Warden Keystones destroyed, no one will EVER be able to enter the Academy and fill their minds with knowledge.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_1": "And without knowledge, they will not be able to resist our mind illusions!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_2": "You seem to know me, but I have no idea who YOU are.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_3": "Bold words. Unfortunately for you, the shadow blast that destroyed the Warden Keystones also drained power from the 6 Wardens themselves.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_4": "Now, nothing stands in our way.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_5": "Are...you...KIDDING ME?! HOW DID WE MISS ONE?!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_6": "WHY CAN'T I GET MY WAY!?!?!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_7": "COME ON! How is this even possible?!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_8": "...That sounds like a good idea.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_9": "Now then, we must make plans for our next steps.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_10": "So, you've gotten quite a lot smarter since our last encounter. No wonder our mind illusions aren't working on you...",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_11": "No matter how strong any one wizard is, they cannot defeat our Titan. This magic has survived for thousands of years, and it won't fail now!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_12": "Good luck! YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT! Hahahahaha!",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_13": "If our mind illusions won't work, we'll just have to put a stop to your efforts the old fashioned way.",
    "DIALOGUE_PUPPET_MASTER_14": "This magic has survived for thousands of years. It won't fail now.",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_0": "6 Wardens? Uh, master, there were only 5 in there...",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_1": "It was a great try though, master, really. Why, no one else in the Order's history has come this close to total victory!",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_2": "Hey there, I have an idea. How about we calm down and figure out a new plan! That sound like a good idea?",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_3": "Master says we need to stop you from becoming powerful. I will do as Master commands!",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_4": "These mountains seem like a perfect hiding place for a Warden. Don't you think?",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_5": "You know where the final Warden is, don't you? Tell me!",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_6": "The less you learn, the stronger our mind illusions get. Let's see what you know!",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_7": "The Order of Influence was defeated here long ago. We won't lose again!",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_8": "You've beaten me this time, but if you stop learning, our mind illusions will overpower you!",
    "DIALOGUE_PIPPIT_9": "The less you learn, the stronger our mind illusions get. Let's see what you know!",
    "DIALOGUE_JULIA_GHOULIA_0": "Why hello again! Looking to purchase some spooky specials?",
    "DIALOGUE_JULIA_GHOULIA_1": "Welcome to Pumpkinfest!",
    "DIALOGUE_JULIA_GHOULIA_2": "Until October 31st, you can purchase Pumpkinfest items from my shop with candy corn cash.",
    "DIALOGUE_JULIA_GHOULIA_3": "Candy corn cash can be earned from wizard battles during the festival.",
    "DIALOGUE_JULIA_GHOULIA_4": "You can also get a LOT of candy corn by rescuing pumpkins. If you find a pumpkin in Lamplight Town that isn't lit, click or tap it.",
    "DIALOGUE_JULIA_GHOULIA_5": "If you can defeat the monster that has taken it over, you will get a bunch more candy corn!",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_0": "Why hello again! Did you find the fallen star in town tonight?",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_1": "Hi there! You can buy Starlight Festival items from my shop right now, but the only way to buy them is by spending Star Shards.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_2": "You can get Star Shards from wizard battles, and find a fallen star in the town to get even more!",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_3": "Why hello there! I'm Mama Star! Welcome to the Starlight Festival!",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_4": "You can purchase Starlight Festival items from my shop with Star Shards.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_5": "Star Shards can be earned from wizard battles during the festival.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_6": "You can also get a LOT of Star Shards by finding fallen stars. If you find a fallen star in Lamplight Town, click or tap it.",

    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_8": "Why hello there! I'm Mama Star! Welcome to the Starlight Festival!",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_9": "You may be wonderin' why Lamplight Town seems to be in twilight?",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_10": "No need to worry darlin', it is all good news! A flight of Epic Dragons are due to arrive in our lands real soon.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_11": "To celebrate their coming I have stocked up on wondrous Dragon themed treasures, treasures that I will sell to you in exchange for Dragon Flies.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_12": "During this festival, you can earn Dragon Flies in wizard battles, or by rescuing fallen stars right here in Lamplight Town.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_13": "Heck, sometimes you can catch em flying wild all over the world.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_14": "Hi there! You can buy Starlight Festival items from my shop right now, but only with Dragon Flies.",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_15": "You can get Dragon Flies from wizard battles anywhere in the world. Rescue a fallen star in Lamplight Town to get even more!",
    "DIALOGUE_MAMA_STAR_16": "And if you keep your eyes open, you might be able to catch wild ones fluttering about.",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_0": "Welcome to Wandering Wares! We specialize in ancient artifacts for powerful wizards, but I'm not interested in gold!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_1": "If you find old copper coins, I'll gladly trade for them.",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_2": "Onto the next area, shall we?",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_3": "This is Arctursus, the arctic powerhouse! The air around Arctursus is always cold - the tips of his fur are made from ice that can't melt!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_4": "Florafox here is guardian of the forests! The bulb on her tail produces a pollen that can heal any plant, no matter how withered it is!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_5": "Don't forget Big Hex, master of mech! This mechano-man is so tough, his static electricity won't let his enemies near him!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_6": "Here's Magmischief, the mischievous magma-loving monster! This sneaky guy loves the heat, but that just makes him cool!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_7": "There's Diveodile, the ocean lord! He can swim faster than a sailboat, and create whirlpools with the smallest flick of his tail!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_8": "Want to try your hand at the Epic Arena? Use your Epic to challenge hordes of enemies and gain awesome rewards!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_9": "Well, now that you've met the Epics, you can see their potential! Just imagine how strong they would be on YOUR team!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_10": "Welcome to the Epics Subspace! This is a world where the Epics live, while resting in their statue forms.",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_11": "It's up to wizards like you to rescue them! When you do, they will join you on your quests!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_12": "Come back soon to challenge the Epic Arena!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_13": "Here you can visit the new Dragons, or the other Epics.",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_14": "Chill & Char are inseparable! Their combo of ice and fire make them a great choice for all kinds of enemies!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_15": "Tidus is rarely seen on land! His power surges upward from the deepest depths of the sea!",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_16": "Luma is a small but powerful dragon. Her spells are powered by the sun, making her almost unstoppable during the day.",
    "DIALOGUE_TOY_17": "Here is Eclipse, master of twilight. His giant wings gather energy as he soars through the night sky.",

    "DIALOGUE_EVE_0": "You did it! Way to go, kid!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_1": "Hey, you!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_2": "The name's Eve, pleasure to meet you! You must be the Prodigy-in-training that everyone's talking about.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_3": "This means that if you pass my test, I'll give you my Warden Keystone, just like the other Guardians on the island.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_4": "You'll be one step closer to stopping the Puppet Master!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_5": "Ever since the Puppet Master returned, the sea people have reported spotting an ancient monster lurking just off the coast.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_6": "I want you to find out if this monster is real, and if so, defeat it.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_7": "But first things first - you'll have to spend some time underwater if you're gonna complete this challenge.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_8": "In order to do that, you'll need to locate a Breathing Bubble so you can go underwater.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_9": "Just head east, then north. You should find one near the wreckage. Bring it back here and I'll get it working for you.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_10": "Allllllright! Now the adventure can REALLY begin!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_11": "There's an archaeologist around these parts. Goes by the name Jelly Jim.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_12": "He spends so much time in the water, there's NO WAY he'd miss a giant monster, if there is one.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_13": "Go chat with him, and see if he knows anything about it.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_14": "We ran into some black goop while trying to search for the monster.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_15": "Without knowing for sure what we're dealing with, we won't know HOW to deal with it.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_16": "Can you grab a sample of the black goop for me to check out?",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_17": "I think you can handle this now. The Order of Influence better watch out!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_18": "Yup, that's definitely monster ink. Just as I thought.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_19": "You're going to need a Sonic Blaster to get through that stuff.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_20": "Fortunately, any sailor worth their sea salt carried one with them, for situations just like this one.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_21": "You should be able to find one in the wreckage of the ships!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_22": "Caaaaan you just give us yours?",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_23": "This is your trial, not mine. Sorry kiddo, you'll just have to find one yourself!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_24": "Once you find it, bring it back to me, and I'll make sure it's in working order.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_25": "I know you can do it!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_26": "Allllright! The next task ahead of you is to clear out that ink with the Sonic Blaster. Give it your best shot!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_27": "Keep your guard up, kiddo. If the Puppet Master's behind this, who knows what's lurking in that ink...",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_28": "Not only am I a pretty good pirate, but I'm also a keen tracker - I could track a falcon on a cloudy day!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_29": "It sounds like the ancient creature IS real after all, based on the description of that tunnel.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_30": "If you bring me back more details about it, I'll be able to figure out exactly what we're going up against!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_31": "Talk to Jelly Jim. He'll be able to think of a way to do that.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_32": "Woooowie. According to the tunnel, this monster is HUGE!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_33": "Just to make sure we know as much about this beast as possible before taking it on, see if you can find anything else it may have left behind.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_34": "The more we know about it, the better.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_35": "Uh oh. It's not just big, but it's got tough skin to boot! These scales are super sturdy.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_36": "I had heard stories about the power of the beast my grandpappy battled, but I didn't ACTUALLY believe it was this strong...",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_37": "You've gotta toughen yourself up if you're gonna go toe-to-tentacle with a beast like that. Battle strong monsters to make sure you're ready.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_38": "Looks like you're tough enough now!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_39": "Now that you're ready, I can tell you where I think the beast is.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_40": "The ink, the tunnel, the scales - they were all found around the wreckage of the pirate ship Antilles. The beast MUST be hiding there.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_41": "It's time to show the Puppet Master's monster who's boss. Good luck.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_42": "Sounds like that door needs a key. Check the ship wreckage, it shouldn't be too far from there.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_43": "This is it, kid. Good luck.",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_44": "Here's the Shipwreck Gem, you've earned it!",
    "DIALOGUE_EVE_45": "Well kid, best be movin' along. I've got things under control here now.",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_0": "Well hello there! My name's Jelly Jim. What brings you to these parts?",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_1": "Now that I think about it, I do recall seeing some sort of large, terrible creature floating around. Just the other day in fact.",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_2": "It looked like it could have been the old sea monster that the evil Order of Influence used here a long time ago against the pirates.",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_3": "Whatever I saw was close by, no doubt.",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_4": "Oh, and one last thing. Here is some gold to help you on your journey. Best of luck!",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_5": "Why hello again, friend! Grand to see you. What can I help you with?",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_6": "You want to show Eve something you found down here? Well, an underwater camera would be perfect for that!",
    "DIALOGUE_JELLY_JIM_7": "Well, I'll be off on other adventures soon. If you see me, could you stop by and say hello? That would be splendid!",
    "DIALOGUE_HARVEY_0": "So, you're joining the battle against the Titan, are you?",
    "DIALOGUE_HARVEY_1": "As you battle it, Titan Shards will break off. Bring them to me, and I can remove the Shadow Magic from them. I'll sell you powerful armor in return.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARVEY_2": "Battle the Titan to earn Titan Shards.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARVEY_3": "Win lots of battles against the Titan to get a BUNCH of Titan Shards, once it's defeated by wizards around the world.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARVEY_4": "Check my sign for more details.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARVEY_5": "Uh oh. I don't think you're strong enough to face the Titan yet. Try reaching level 8 first.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_0": "Ponduberous! You certainly are helpful, young chap!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_1": "Let's get to it, then! Ready to help OINC?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_2": "Well now, what have we here? A young explorer in training, perhaps?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_3": "Oh, but where are my manners? I, my young friend, am Professor Scoog...perhaps you've heard of me?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_4": "...no?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_5": "Hm, well that's quite alright. I am the leader of the Oasis Institute of Natural Creatures! Or, OINC, for short.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_6": "Right now we're in the middle of a very important dig, and we sure could use your help!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_7": "First, let's see what you're made of! We've been overrun by Scallys the last few days...makes it hard to dig. Go challenge a few for me, will you?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_8": "You did it, young wizard! As a token of my gratitude, take this shovel!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_9": "The shovel will allow you to help us dig for fossils! To do so, just click the spinning star nearby!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_10": "Now then, OINC has chosen this site for its greatest quest - the search for Dynos!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_11": "Dynos are monsters that are long extinct, and have left their fossilized remains here in the oasis.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_12": "We want to learn more about them, so we work hard to dig them up!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_13": "Now that you have a shovel, you can help! Try digging for a Terrosaur bone, or challenge some monsters who carry them.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_14": "While you were away, a monster came and STOLE MY HAT! Be a dear and go fetch it for me, will you?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_15": "THAT'S IT! Ah, my lucky hat...though truth is, I do have quite a few lucky hats...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_16": "...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_17": "WHAT!?!?!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_18": "YOU SAW A DYNO?!?! PONDUBEROUS!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_19": "You know what? Keep the hat! Consider yourself an honorary member of OINC!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_20": "A real dyno! Oh my...we have much to do! First, we must ensure that these Dynos are safe!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_21": "Defeat a few fire monsters for me...fire monsters in a dry forest are BAD NEWS!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_22": "Well now, I think it is time to find our new dyno friends! First, let's see if you can track down some Terromites! Let's see how they battle!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_23": "Oh, and bring back anything they might be carrying!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_24": "OH NO! This item you brought me is an animal tag...this can only mean one thing...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_25": "This animal tag proves that someone has been mistreating these Dynos...and only one man would do such a thing...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_26": "PROFESSOR MOOG!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_27": "Moog is a despicable dastardly deviant, who believes that monsters are meant to be kept in cages. Preposterous!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_28": "We must help the Dynos! Go out there and remove all the tags you can find!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_29": "Good work! Here's a new shovel...it will help you dig faster when looking for fossils!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_30": "We've slowed down Moog for now, but his men are probably out there right now, capturing these Dynos...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_31": "I have an idea! Go find Moog's men, and challenge them. Perhaps one of them will have a written copy of Moog's evil scheme.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_32": "Moog is dastardly, but he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed...",

    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_35": "That's not very original at all.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_36": "Regardless, we must stop him at all costs! Go out there and find his head assistant, Spokes. If you defeat him, maybe he and his men will leave.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_37": "It looks like Spokes and his men have left...for now. But they will be back, I assure you!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_38": "For now, we have other matters. A new dyno has been stealing equipment from the dig site...see if you can bring it back.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_39": "Ponduberous! That's 3 Dynos you've found now, alive and well! Oh, how I would love to study them in their natural habitat.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_40": "Alas, the world of science must wait. With Moog still out there, the Dynos will never be safe.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_41": "According to his novel, he next plans to steal dyno eggs. The audacity!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_42": "We must act quickly! Go out there, face his egg collectors, and bring back the eggs!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_43": "You're doing great work, my friend! We're stopping Moog at every turn!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_44": "But all is not well in the natural world. Some pterrotell have been attacking anyone who comes near...perhaps something has them spooked?",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_45": "Find and challenge them for me...perhaps the battle will sooth these Dynos.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_46": "OH NO! It looks like one of Moog's men have captured a team of Dynos!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_47": "You'd better defeat him and release those poor Dynos!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_48": "Enough is enough! It's time to get rid of Moog once and for all!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_49": "I have a theory about Dynos...I believe that a large group of Dynos is run by a single dyno, which I call the Primo Dyno.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_50": "This dyno would be big! And mean! And scary! Scary enough to frighten off Moog forever!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_51": "So, I say we track down this Primo Dyno! First, you'll need to find the nest. Defeat a few Dynos, and they should lead us there.",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_52": "Good! I think we know where the nest is! No sign of the Primo Dyno, so we may have to lure it back somehow...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_53": "I know! The digging equipment! The loud noises must have disrupted the Dynos...that's why they were stealing it!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_54": "I'll turn on the equipment now...you may have to defeat a few larger Dynos before the Primo Dyno gets here...",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_55": "I hear something coming! It must be the Primo Dyno!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_56": "...what's that on his back...?",

    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_59": "You did it!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_60": "It appears that Professor Moog wasn't riding the Primo Dyno after all...he was a captive himself! Oh, the irony!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_61": "Well my friend, I don't think Moog will be bothering these Dynos anymore, and we have you to thank!",
    "DIALOGUE_PROFESSOR_SCOOG_62": "Here, take this shovel - it's the strongest one we have! As a member of OINC, keep up the digging! Who knows what you might find!",

    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_DEFEAT_0": "Wow...You beat me...I'm speechless...",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_DEFEAT_1": "I can't believe I lost to a wizard from the Academy...I thought I was the strongest!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_DEFEAT_2": "Well then! It looks like I was wrong about you...and about the Academy! You really are the best of the best!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_DEFEAT_3": "Here...please accept this new robe as a gift from me. And tell all your friends to come here as well!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_DEFEAT_4": "I'd love to meet as many wizards as possible...especially if they're as strong as you!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_0": "Oh no! Only members can access the tower right now!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_1": "Hello there, young one...welcome to the Dark Tower.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_2": "The name's Mira, and this tower was once the home to a powerful wizard, who built it to test the power of other wizards.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_3": "It is said that whoever can conquer every floor and make it to the top is a true wizard.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_4": "But there is a catch! The battles here are harder, and once you leave the tower, you must start over.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_5": "However, if you defeat the opponents on every 5th floor, you can return to that floor if you leave.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_6": "Well hello there! If it isn't the fancy-pants wizard!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_7": "You already beat my tower...but come back someday... I may have more challenges for you!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_8": "Oh no....you don't have enough gold!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_9": "Here's your first boss...there is one on every fifth floor. Let's see how well you do!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_10": "The wizard of this tower was once a student at the Academy, just like you...",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_11": "But the wizard was MUCH stronger! WAAAAAY stronger!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_12": "The wizard practiced alone, not wanting any help from the other Academy students.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_13": "He didn't want to waste time on them - they would only hold him back.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_14": "So the wizard left the Academy a long long time ago...to train alone.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_15": "He came here and built this tower using his awesome power! What a guy!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_16": "You made it to floor 25! One quarter of the way there...not bad, but not great.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_17": "For years and years the wizard trained here alone. He mastered all the elements, learned all the spells.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_18": "...But the wizard didn't need any help from the dumb Academy to do it!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_19": "One day, the wizard decided he was done training - he was already the best wizard ever!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_20": "So he decided to challenge the other wizards at the Academy, to prove he was the best.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_21": "No wizard could match him, and so the wizard created this super-cool test to challenge wizards instead!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_22": "He called it the 'Really Really Hard Test of Trials'!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_23": "For this test, the wizard summoned the strongest monsters possible to challenge wizards at each floor.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_24": "These monsters are the bosses of this tower. Here's another one now!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_25": "Floor 50 already....you've come all this way to challenge the strongest, have you?",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_26": "If so, then you must first challenge the father of all dragons...Grandoff!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_27": "You are certainly something special...are you sure you're from the Academy?",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_28": "The test you are on now...this is the very same test created by the wizard himself.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_29": "Many wizards from the Academy tried it, but they ALL failed!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_30": "For each new student that tried the test and failed, the wizard added a new floor...and a new challenge.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_31": "When no more floors could be added, the wizard made the challenges harder and harder.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_32": "Eventually, it became obvious that no wizards would be able to climb the tower.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_33": "So the legendary wizard disappeared, and the tower began to crumble.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_34": "The wizard has not been seen since, but students from the Academy still try to climb the tower.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_35": "He hoped that someday a student would be strong enough to challenge him, and so he would return to accept the challenge.",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_36": "Things have been easy up until now...I think it's time to step things up!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_37": "You're still going? I'm...impressed!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_38": "This can't be...no wizards have ever made it this far...",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_39": "...Who are you...?",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_40": "No...you will NOT make it to the top of this tower!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_41": "Face your next challenge...it will be your last here!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_42": "Astounding. You have made it to the top of my tower...",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_43": "And so you have earned the greatest of rewards...you must challenge the legendary wizard herself...",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_44": "ME! THE GREAT AND POWERFUL MIRA SHADE!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_45": "HAHAHA! It was me all along! You should see the look on your face right now!",
    "DIALOGUE_MIRA_46": "Come, wizard! It's time for you to face the strongest wizard of all time!",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_0": "Only Foxes should have our Magic Eggs! I, the great Don Zorro of the noble Fox Knights, refuse to let these sneaky rabbits get one single egg.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_1": "Excuse me!? How dare you speak to me in that way. You should be grateful that we Knights don't run you right out of town.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_2": "Hah! We'll see about that. Not even the Puppet Master stands a chance against the great Don Zorro!",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_3": "And don't think riffraff like bunnies are welcome into Fort Fox! Only friends of the Foxes are allowed past our guard.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_4": "Here Wizard, take a Fox cap. Wear it if you want to get in...",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_5": "Well well, what do we have here? I am the magnificent Don Zorro, captain of the Fox forces.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_6": "You have permission to admire me while I tell you of our tale.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_7": "Every spring the sneaky bunnies seek to steal the Magic Eggs that rightfully should go to us Foxes. What impudence!",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_8": "Bring ME any Eggs you find while fighting monsters out in the world.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_9": "You look brave, so I will give you a quest. Search for a clutch of Magic Eggs that spawns someplace in Lamplight Town.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_10": "But the Puppet Master also wants the Magic Eggs, and you may have to thrash his minions to get the eggs.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_11": "I am willing to trade some of our wondrous Fox items to whoever brings me Magic Eggs. Yes, even you. Here, look upon our fine goods!",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_12": "Who approaches the brave Don Zorro, champion of the Foxes? Oh, it is just you.",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_13": "Did you defeat any Puppet Master minions in Lamplight, or monsters in the wide world? Ahem...you HAVE brought us Magic Eggs, correct?",
    "DIALOGUE_DON_ZORRO_14": "Then look at our store full of fine fox goods, and see if you can look more like...ME!",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_0": "YOUR Magic Eggs? Hah! You crack me up. The Forest Bunny Bandits don't take orders from anyone. You got that foxy?",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_1": "Ooo, I'm scared. Well you can tell your fuzzy orange servants that I, Harriet Hood, will never let you get your dirty paws on all the Magic Eggs.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_2": "Blah blah blah. Look Wizard, here is a Bunny Cap. Wear it when you come see us. Only Bunny Bandit buddies are allowed into The Burrow.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_3": "The name's Harriet Hood. Welcome to The Burrow. You've made the right decision coming here.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_4": "I'm sorry that you had to listen to that crazy Fox. No one takes what rightfully belongs to us, the Bunny Bandits!",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_5": "Those sly Foxes are always meddling in our business, taking all the Magic Eggs they can find. No need to worry though, we have YOU on our side!",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_6": "Listen, you can do me a favor by collecting Magic Eggs from monsters out in the world and bringing them here, to me.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_7": "And a little birdy told me that once a day a pile of Magic Eggs spawns someplace in Lamplight Town.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_8": "The Puppet Master also wants the Magic Eggs, so you may have to fight for them.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_9": "In exchange for the Eggs, I promise you some of our best wares, which we came by totally honestly. What do you say?",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_10": "Look who we have here. I told the other buddies we could count on you. We CAN count on you right?",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_11": "All you gotta do is just keep fighting monsters and collecting OUR Magic Eggs. I heard there was a bundle somewhere in Lamplight today.",
    "DIALOGUE_HARRIET_12": "Enough chit-chat. if you brought something we want, maybe we have something you want?",
    "DIALOGUE_VERNA_0": "HALT! Who do you think you are? Only those who show loyalty to the noble Foxes may enter.  Don't you have a Fox hat of some kind?",
    "DIALOGUE_VERNA_1": "You need to be wearing a Fox hat like this!",
    "DIALOGUE_VERNA_2": "Halt! No Bunny buddies allowed! Only Foxes past this point!",
    "DIALOGUE_VERNA_3": "Welcome fellow Fox! Boo to the Bunnies!",
    "DIALOGUE_BARGO_0": "Hold up bub, you don't look like a Bandit. What are you trying to pull?",
    "DIALOGUE_BARGO_1": "Don't you have some Bunny swag?  You wanna get in with the bunnies, you need to look like a bunny.",
    "DIALOGUE_BARGO_2": "You need to be wearing a Bunny hat like this!",
    "DIALOGUE_BARGO_3": "Heyo Holdup!!! Listen Foxface, just turn your long tail around and scram. You get my drift?",
    "DIALOGUE_BARGO_4": "Hey there good bunny buddy! Hop right in, fresh carrots on the table.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_0": "Noot! Is that you?!",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_1": "So you got my letter! Where did you find this wizard? How powerful are they?",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_2": "Oh, where are my manners, I forgot to introduce myself.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_3": "I'm Gale, the Keeper of the Academy.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_4": "Well, I was. I don't know if I can call myself that anymore with what has happened.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_5": "I suppose it's my fault that we're in this mess.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_6": "Thank you, Noot.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_7": "Actually, since you're here, there IS something you could help me with, if you're up to the task.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_8": "Good to hear.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_9": "The Academy's Archives contain valuable pages of information that wizards need to study.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_10": "However, the Puppet Master has cast a powerful spell mixing up all of the Archive's rooms and making them a mess!",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_11": "I would go to retrieve the pages myself, but the mess and confusion makes my head spin. So I need you to go down instead.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_12": "Any pages you come across, please bring them back to the Academy's merchant. He will reward you in turn for your help.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_13": "Oh, and one last thing! Here is an amulet that will let you warp into the Academy.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_14": "Best of luck. I'm counting on you.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_15": "Sorry, I still haven't found out how to break that lock yet.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_16": "Don't worry, I'll keep researching.",
    "DIALOGUE_GALE_17": "I think I've managed to fix the Earth keystone pedestal! Once you have the Earth keystone and are level 25, come to the Academy to place the Earth keystone in its pedestal!\n\n -Gale",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_0": "That'd be a pretty good guess.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_1": "I'm trapped in my office thanks to the Puppet Master and I'd take a wild guess and say the other Wardens are in a verrrry similar situation.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_2": "Anyways, I'm gonna need your help. The door is locked, and there's no way for me to get out of here.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_3": "I'm guessing the Puppet Master hid the key somewhere. ",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_4": "If you ask me, it's probably on the eighth floor of this tower. That's the highest it goes.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_5": "Then get to it. Don't leave me waiting here forever.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_6": "To get to floor eight, you have to go through all seven floors before it. ",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_7": "Keep an eye out for monsters - I'm sure the place is flooded with them.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_8": "Good luck.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_9": "One floor down, seven to go..",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_10": "The tower is usually filled with students studying earth magic. I mean of course they'd pick that to study, it's easily the best magic out there.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_11": "You know, my sister Flora almost taught here. But I guess she didn't want to leaf firefly forest.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_12": "Halfway there, keep it up. No thoughts of quitting now when you've gotten this far.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_13": "I could really go for some pizza right now. You have no idea how boring it is in here.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_14": "The Academy has been around for about 100 years now. Wonder why the Puppet Master chose now of all times to pull this stunt.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_15": "The final floor. You're almost done, which means I'm almost out of here. So let's wrap this thing up.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_16": "Phew, I thought I was going to be stuck in that bubble for ages. Thanks kid.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_17": "I can't say I do. If I had to guess, I'd say they're in the same situation I was in.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_18": "I'd go look for them now, but that bubble drained a ton of my magic. It'll take me some time to gain back my strength.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_19": "It's up to you to go rescue the others. Once all of us are together, I'm sure we can take down that good-for-nothing Puppet Master once and for all.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_20": "I'll be waiting for you in the common room when you're ready.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_21": "Oh, I have something that can help you out in your journey.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_22": "That's a Brumble. The lil' guy has been with me for ages, and he's one tough earth pet.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_23": "Take him with you. He'll help you out in rescuing the others, especially in the water tower.",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_24": "Well, best of luck kid!",
    "DIALOGUE_FLORIAN_25": "No sense in freezing up now kid. Slide on over to the ice tower.",
